`mark-shot` is a high-performance screenshot and annotation tool built with Qt 6. It was originally designed for Wayland compositors such as `niri`, and it also supports standard screenshot and annotation workflows on X11/GNOME desktops.

It captures screen frames instantly and opens an interactive fullscreen overlay, providing region cropping, rich annotation, clipboard copying, saving, and desktop pinning features.

---

## Features

### Advanced Annotation Toolset
- **Pen & Highlighter**: Smooth freehand drawing and semi-transparent overlay highlighting.
- **Geometric Shapes**: High-precision Line, Rectangle, and Ellipse paths.
- **Refined Arrow**: Sharp 6-vertex acute arrow path rendering with anti-aliasing.
- **Dual-Gesture Text**:
  - Supports font sizes up to `1000px`, adjustable via scroll wheel or property sliders.
  - Implements a physical width buffer to prevent unexpected wrapping across extreme scales.
  - **Diagonal handles** scale font size and boundary box proportionally; **side borders** only adjust wrap width.
- **Laser Pointer**: Dedicated presentation tool with pen traces that dissolve smoothly over time.
- **Auto-Increment Marker**: Click to stamp sequential numbered markers.
- **Mosaic**: Applies high-fidelity acrylic frost blur to obscure sensitive information.

### Pinned Window Stickers
- Pins any cropped region or annotated screenshot as an independent, frameless, and top-level floating window.
- Supports direct selection of OCR-recognized text in the pinned window, with `Ctrl + C` and context-menu copying.
- Supports OpenAI-compatible LLM translation for OCR text, rendering translated text back onto the image at the original layout positions.
- **Interactive Gestures**:
  - Drag with left click to reposition.
  - Scroll mouse wheel to scale, or double-tap `Ctrl` to reset to original aspect ratio.
  - Double left-click or press `Esc` to close.
  - Right-click to open a context menu with options to rotate, copy image text, translate, save, copy, or adjust opacity (0.2 to 1.0).

### Scrolling Screenshot Capture
- Captures a long scrolling region by combining PipeWire screencast frames with an interactive scrolling overlay and stitcher.
- Designed primarily for `niri` and similar Wayland environments where output geometry and capture timing can be controlled predictably.
- **Compatibility notice**: scrolling capture on KDE, GNOME, X11, and other non-`niri` environments is a test feature and is not complete yet. Portal backends, shell policies, window geometry behavior, frame timing, and scroll event handling differ substantially across these desktop stacks.
- If scrolling capture fails, use normal screenshots or configure an external long-screenshot command through Mark Shot extension commands.
- To report a scrolling capture issue, run `DEBUG=1 mark-shot`, reproduce the failure, then attach `/tmp/mark-shot-scroll.log` to a GitHub issue. Set `MARK_SHOT_DEBUG_LOG=/path/to/log` if the log should be written elsewhere.

### Cross-Platform Display Server Support
- **Wayland**: Uses PipeWire portal screencast for experimental scrolling capture, `grim` for wlroots screenshot capture, `layer-shell-qt` for native overlay, and `wl-copy` for clipboard persistence.
- **X11**: Uses `QScreen::grabWindow` for screen capture, fullscreen top-level window for overlay, and `xclip` for clipboard persistence.
- Runtime auto-detection via `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` — no configuration needed.

### Desktop Integration
- **Desktop Entries**:
  - `mark-shot.desktop`: Configures the utility system-wide, triggerable by custom shortcuts.
  - `mark-shot-edit.desktop`: Registers as an image editor, enabling users to right-click local files in file managers (Dolphin, Nautilus, etc.) and open them directly in annotation mode.
- Ships with scalable vector icons (`mark-shot.svg` and `mark-shot-edit.svg`).

## Usage

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

```bash
# Capture screen with interactive region selection
mark-shot

# Capture all outputs on a multi-monitor setup
mark-shot --all-outputs

# Annotate full captured screen directly (skipping selection)
mark-shot --fullscreen

# Open and annotate an existing local image file
mark-shot path/to/image.png

# Force standard XDG window instead of Wayland layer-shell
mark-shot --xdg-window
```

### CLI Arguments

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `[file]` | **Positional**: Opens an existing local image in annotation mode instead of capturing the screen. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Displays help information and exits. |
| `-v`, `--version` | Displays version information and exits. |
| `--all-outputs` | Captures all screens on the virtual display environment instead of only the active one. |
| `--xdg-window` | Forces the use of a standard XDG fullscreen window (xdg-shell) instead of layer-shell. |
| `--fullscreen` | Skips region selection and opens annotation mode on the full screen frame directly. |

### Compositor / Desktop Hotkey Integration

To bind `mark-shot` to a system screenshot shortcut, configure your compositor or desktop environment.

**niri** (`~/.config/niri/config.kdl`):
```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+S { spawn "mark-shot"; }
}
```

**GNOME** (via custom keyboard shortcut in Settings → Keyboard → Custom Shortcuts).

### Extension Commands

The right-side action toolbar includes an **Extensions** button. It reads user-defined commands from `~/.config/mark-shot/extensions.json`. The file can be either a JSON array or an object with a `commands` array.

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "Long screenshot",
      "command": "./target/release/wayscrollshot {slurp}",
      "workingDirectory": "~/Desktop/projects/wayscrollshot",
      "closeOnStart": true
    },
    {
      "name": "OCR selection",
      "command": "ocr-tool {image}",
      "saveImage": true
    }
  ]
}
```

`command` is executed through `$SHELL -c`, so shell features work. Use `{slurp}` to pass the current selection as `x,y widthxheight` geometry. Use `{image}` or `{imagePath}` to pass the current rendered selection as a temporary PNG path, or `{imageUrl}` for a `file://` URL. These placeholders are shell-quoted automatically. Set `saveImage` or `needsImage` to `true` to append the temporary PNG path when no image placeholder is present. `workingDirectory` and `cwd` are aliases. `closeOnStart` defaults to `true`, hiding and closing Mark Shot before the command starts.

### Pinned OCR and LLM Translation Config

Pinned windows read OCR and translation settings from `~/.config/mark-shot/config.json`. The default OCR helper prefers `rapidocr` and can fall back to `tesseract`. The translation helper calls an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint.

```json
{
  "windowDetection": {
    "command": "mark-shot-window-detection-niri",
    "timeoutMs": 1000
  },
  "ocr": {
    "enabled": true,
    "backend": "rapidocr",
    "command": "",
    "timeoutMs": 30000
  },
  "translation": {
    "targetLanguage": "Simplified Chinese",
    "apiBase": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "apiKeyEnv": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "apiKey": "",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "timeoutMs": 60000,
    "timeoutSeconds": 60,
    "systemPrompt": "",
    "command": ""
  }
}
```

### Pre-Capture Window Detection & Script Contribution Guide

To ensure precise window boundary detection across different Wayland compositors (such as niri, Hyprland, etc.), Mark Shot uses a flexible external script invocation mechanism. Users can configure a detection script via `windowDetection.command`. The script is responsible for querying window geometries from the compositor and outputting the data in a unified format for Mark Shot to consume.

We highly welcome and encourage community members to contribute adapter scripts for various desktop environments and Wayland compositors to expand compatibility.

#### 1. Input Provided to the Script (Environment Variables)

When invoked, Mark Shot passes the following environment variables to provide context about the current screen capture session:

| Variable Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `MARK_SHOT_CONFIG` | String | Path to the config file (typically `~/.config/mark-shot/config.json`) |
| `MARK_SHOT_CAPTURE_OUTPUT` | String | Name of the output display to capture (e.g., `eDP-1`, `DP-2`) |
| `MARK_SHOT_CAPTURE_ALL_OUTPUTS` | Integer | `1` to capture all outputs; `0` to capture only the active screen |
| `MARK_SHOT_CAPTURE_X` | Integer | The logical start X coordinate of the capture area in the compositor |
| `MARK_SHOT_CAPTURE_Y` | Integer | The logical start Y coordinate of the capture area in the compositor |
| `MARK_SHOT_CAPTURE_WIDTH` | Integer | Logical width of the capture area |
| `MARK_SHOT_CAPTURE_HEIGHT` | Integer | Logical height of the capture area |

> [!NOTE]
> All window coordinates returned by the script must be in **global logical compositor coordinates**, matching the screen geometry queried by Qt. This prevents scaling or layout offset issues in multi-monitor setups.

#### 2. Agreed Output JSON Formats

The script must print detected window metadata as JSON to its standard output (`stdout`). The parser supports a wide range of compatible formats:

##### Root Node Schema
The root element can be an object containing a `windows` or `windowGeometries` array, or it can be a JSON array directly.
- **Option A (Wrapped Object)**: `{ "windows": [ ... ] }` or `{ "windowGeometries": [ ... ] }`
- **Option B (Direct Object representing one window)**: `{ "x": 100, "y": 100, "w": 400, "h": 300 }`
- **Option C (Direct Array)**: `[ ... ]`

##### Window Geometry Object Structures
Each element in the array (or the root object itself) can take one of the following four formats:

- **Key-Value Properties (Object)**:
  Directly defines integer fields for positions and sizes.
  - Horizontal coordinate keys: `x` or `left`
  - Vertical coordinate keys: `y` or `top`
  - Width keys: `width` or `w`
  - Height keys: `height` or `h`
  *Example*: `{ "x": 100, "y": 200, "w": 800, "h": 600 }`

- **Nested Coordinates/Sizes (Object)**:
  Uses the `at` field (as `[x, y]`) and the `size` field (as `[width, height]`).
  *Example*: `{ "at": [100, 200], "size": [800, 600] }`

- **Array / Inner Array Representation**:
  Directly lists 4 integers: `[x, y, width, height]`.
  Alternatively, specified under the `rect` property of an object.
  *Example*: `[100, 200, 800, 600]` or `{ "rect": [100, 200, 800, 600] }`

- **Geometry String Representation**:
  Uses a string matching the `x,y widthxheight` pattern (allows negative coordinates and spaces).
  Alternatively, specified under the `geometry` property of an object.
  *Example*: `"100,200 800x600"` or `{ "geometry": "100,200 800x600" }`

#### 3. How to Contribute Adapters

Currently, the repository only ships an adapter script for the niri window manager: `mark-shot-window-detection-niri`.

If you run Mark Shot on Hyprland, Sway, KDE (KWin Wayland), or GNOME (Mutter Wayland) and have configured a working script, please submit a Pull Request to share it with the community. Here are implementation guidelines for different environments:
- **Hyprland**: Use `hyprctl clients -j` and parse the output JSON.
- **Sway**: Use `swaymsg -t get_tree` to fetch the layout tree.
- **KDE / KWin**: Implement a simple KWin Script, or query KWin's D-Bus interfaces.
- **GNOME**: Since GNOME Wayland lacks an official client-side shell command to query window geometry, you typically need to write a GNOME Shell extension that exports Mutter's window geometry over D-Bus, then query that D-Bus interface in your script.

If the script fails to execute or times out (default: `1000ms`), Mark Shot will proceed with screenshot capture normally and fall back to its internal X11-based window detector where applicable.

When installing manually, install `mark-shot`, `mark-shot-ocr`, and `mark-shot-translate` together. Otherwise the pinned window opens, but image-text copying and translation cannot call the backend helpers.

## Compilation & Installation

### Official Release Artifacts

Each release publishes Linux binary archives and Debian packages:

- `linux-x86_64.tar.gz` and `linux-arm64.tar.gz`
- `amd64.deb` and `arm64.deb`

The Debian package installs `mark-shot`, helper scripts, desktop entries, icons, and runtime metadata together.

### Dependencies

#### Wayland (Arch Linux)

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake ninja pkgconf qt6-base qt6-wayland layer-shell-qt pipewire grim wl-clipboard
```

#### X11/GNOME (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Build essentials
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config libpipewire-0.3-dev

# Portal and clipboard tools
sudo apt install xdg-desktop-portal pipewire xclip

# Qt 6 (if not available in system repos, install via aqtinstall)
pip install aqtinstall
aqt install-qt linux desktop 6.7.3 gcc_64 --outputdir ~/Qt
```

> **Note**: On Ubuntu 22.04 where the system ships Qt 5, installing Qt 6 to `~/Qt` keeps the system untouched. Pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64` when configuring.

#### fcitx5 Chinese Input Method (Qt 6 on X11)

Qt 6 does not ship a fcitx5 input context plugin. To enable Chinese input, build the plugin from source:

```bash
sudo apt install libfcitx5utils-dev libfcitx5config-dev libfcitx5core-dev libfcitx5-qt-dev extra-cmake-modules

git clone --depth 1 --branch 5.0.10 https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx5-qt.git /tmp/fcitx5-qt
cmake -B /tmp/fcitx5-qt/build -S /tmp/fcitx5-qt \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64 \
  -DENABLE_QT4=OFF -DENABLE_QT5=OFF -DENABLE_QT6=ON
cmake --build /tmp/fcitx5-qt/build

cp /tmp/fcitx5-qt/build/qt6/platforminputcontext/libfcitx5platforminputcontextplugin.so \
   ~/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64/plugins/platforminputcontexts/
cp /tmp/fcitx5-qt/build/qt6/dbusaddons/libFcitx5Qt6DBusAddons.so* \
   ~/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64/lib/
```

#### OCR Backend (Optional)

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.local/share/mark-shot/ocr-venv
~/.local/share/mark-shot/ocr-venv/bin/pip install -U pip rapidocr onnxruntime
```

### Build Steps

```bash
# With system Qt 6
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# If Qt 6 is installed under the user directory, add CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64

# Build
cmake --build build
```

LayerShellQt is detected automatically. When found, full Wayland layer-shell support is enabled. When absent, the build succeeds and falls back to standard fullscreen windows at runtime.

### Installation

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix "$HOME/.local"
```

This installs the binary, helper scripts (`mark-shot-ocr`, `mark-shot-translate`), desktop entries, and icons.

## Release Notes

### 0.1.14

- Improved portal screencast negotiation, crop normalization, and first-frame timing for scrolling capture.
- Updated scrolling screenshot documentation: KDE, GNOME, X11, and other non-`niri` environments remain test targets and still need debug logs for issue reports.
- Synced the application version with the CMake project version to avoid stale `--version` output.

### 0.1.13

- Fixed scrolling screenshot selection geometry on scaled `niri` outputs.

### 0.1.12

- Added experimental native scrolling screenshot capture for Wayland.
- Reworked the annotation property panel into a compact icon-based layout.
- Added alternate arrow styles, including a KDE/Spectacle-like arrow.
- Improved GNOME portal behavior by avoiding duplicate host portal app registration.
- Added Linux ARM64 tarball and Ubuntu/Debian ARM64 `.deb` release artifacts.
- Improved PipeWire SPA header compatibility for older distributions.

Scrolling screenshot capture is not guaranteed on GNOME or KDE. The feature depends on portal capture behavior, compositor timing, window geometry, and scroll event handling, so robust GNOME/KDE support has a high adaptation cost.
