`mark-shot` is a high-performance screenshot and annotation tool built with Qt 6. Originally designed for Wayland compositors such as `niri`, it now also runs natively on X11/GNOME desktops.

It captures screen frames instantly and opens an interactive fullscreen overlay, providing region cropping, rich annotation, clipboard copying, saving, and desktop pinning features.

## Features

### Advanced Annotation Toolset
- **Pen & Highlighter**: Smooth freehand drawing and semi-transparent overlay highlighting.
- **Geometric Shapes**: High-precision Line, Rectangle, and Ellipse paths.
- **Refined Arrow**: Sharp 6-vertex acute arrow path rendering with anti-aliasing.
- **Dual-Gesture Text**:
  - Supports font sizes up to `1000px`, adjustable via scroll wheel or property sliders.
  - Implements a physical width buffer to prevent unexpected wrapping across extreme scales.
  - **Diagonal handles** scale font size and boundary box proportionally; **side borders** only adjust wrap width.
- **Laser Pointer**: Dedicated presentation tool with pen traces that dissolve smoothly over time.
- **Auto-Increment Marker**: Click to stamp sequential numbered markers.
- **Mosaic**: Applies high-fidelity acrylic frost blur to obscure sensitive information.

### Pinned Window Stickers
- Pins any cropped region or annotated screenshot as an independent, frameless, and top-level floating window.
- Supports direct selection of OCR-recognized text in the pinned window, with `Ctrl + C` and context-menu copying.
- Supports OpenAI-compatible LLM translation for OCR text, rendering translated text back onto the image at the original layout positions.
- **Interactive Gestures**:
  - Drag with left click to reposition.
  - Scroll mouse wheel to scale, or double-tap `Ctrl` to reset to original aspect ratio.
  - Double left-click or press `Esc` to close.
  - Right-click to open a context menu with options to rotate, copy image text, translate, save, copy, or adjust opacity (0.2 to 1.0).

### Cross-Platform Display Server Support
- **Wayland**: Uses `grim` for screen capture, `layer-shell-qt` for native overlay, and `wl-copy` for clipboard persistence.
- **X11**: Uses `QScreen::grabWindow` for screen capture, fullscreen top-level window for overlay, and `xclip` for clipboard persistence.
- Runtime auto-detection via `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` — no configuration needed.

### Desktop Integration
- **Desktop Entries**:
  - `mark-shot.desktop`: Configures the utility system-wide, triggerable by custom shortcuts.
  - `mark-shot-edit.desktop`: Registers as an image editor, enabling users to right-click local files in file managers (Dolphin, Nautilus, etc.) and open them directly in annotation mode.
- Ships with scalable vector icons (`mark-shot.svg` and `mark-shot-edit.svg`).

## Usage

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

```bash
# Capture screen with interactive region selection
mark-shot

# Capture all outputs on a multi-monitor setup
mark-shot --all-outputs

# Annotate full captured screen directly (skipping selection)
mark-shot --fullscreen

# Open and annotate an existing local image file
mark-shot path/to/image.png

# Force standard XDG window instead of Wayland layer-shell
mark-shot --xdg-window
```

### CLI Arguments

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `[file]` | **Positional**: Opens an existing local image in annotation mode instead of capturing the screen. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Displays help information and exits. |
| `-v`, `--version` | Displays version information and exits. |
| `--all-outputs` | Captures all screens on the virtual display environment instead of only the active one. |
| `--xdg-window` | Forces the use of a standard XDG fullscreen window (xdg-shell) instead of layer-shell. |
| `--fullscreen` | Skips region selection and opens annotation mode on the full screen frame directly. |

### Compositor / Desktop Hotkey Integration

To bind `mark-shot` to a system screenshot shortcut, configure your compositor or desktop environment.

**niri** (`~/.config/niri/config.kdl`):
```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+S { spawn "mark-shot"; }
}
```

**GNOME** (via custom keyboard shortcut in Settings → Keyboard → Custom Shortcuts).

### Extension Commands

The right-side action toolbar includes an **Extensions** button. It reads user-defined commands from `~/.config/mark-shot/extensions.json`. The file can be either a JSON array or an object with a `commands` array.

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "Long screenshot",
      "command": "./target/release/wayscrollshot {slurp}",
      "workingDirectory": "~/Desktop/projects/wayscrollshot",
      "closeOnStart": true
    },
    {
      "name": "OCR selection",
      "command": "ocr-tool {image}",
      "saveImage": true
    }
  ]
}
```

`command` is executed through `$SHELL -c`, so shell features work. Use `{slurp}` to pass the current selection as `x,y widthxheight` geometry. Use `{image}` or `{imagePath}` to pass the current rendered selection as a temporary PNG path, or `{imageUrl}` for a `file://` URL. These placeholders are shell-quoted automatically. Set `saveImage` or `needsImage` to `true` to append the temporary PNG path when no image placeholder is present. `workingDirectory` and `cwd` are aliases. `closeOnStart` defaults to `true`, hiding and closing Mark Shot before the command starts.

### Pinned OCR and LLM Translation Config

Pinned windows read OCR and translation settings from `~/.config/mark-shot/config.json`. The default OCR helper prefers `rapidocr` and can fall back to `tesseract`. The translation helper calls an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint.

```json
{
  "ocr": {
    "enabled": true,
    "backend": "rapidocr",
    "command": "",
    "timeoutMs": 30000
  },
  "translation": {
    "targetLanguage": "Simplified Chinese",
    "apiBase": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "apiKeyEnv": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "apiKey": "",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "timeoutMs": 60000,
    "timeoutSeconds": 60,
    "systemPrompt": "",
    "command": ""
  }
}
```

When installing manually, install `mark-shot`, `mark-shot-ocr`, and `mark-shot-translate` together. Otherwise the pinned window opens, but image-text copying and translation cannot call the backend helpers.

## Compilation & Installation

### Dependencies

#### Wayland (Arch Linux)

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake ninja qt6-base qt6-wayland layer-shell-qt grim wl-clipboard
```

#### X11/GNOME (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Build essentials
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build

# Clipboard tool
sudo apt install xclip

# Qt 6 (if not available in system repos, install via aqtinstall)
pip install aqtinstall
aqt install-qt linux desktop 6.7.3 gcc_64 --outputdir ~/Qt
```

> **Note**: On Ubuntu 22.04 where the system ships Qt 5, installing Qt 6 to `~/Qt` keeps the system untouched. Pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64` when configuring.

#### fcitx5 Chinese Input Method (Qt 6 on X11)

Qt 6 does not ship a fcitx5 input context plugin. To enable Chinese input, build the plugin from source:

```bash
sudo apt install libfcitx5utils-dev libfcitx5config-dev libfcitx5core-dev libfcitx5-qt-dev extra-cmake-modules

git clone --depth 1 --branch 5.0.10 https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx5-qt.git /tmp/fcitx5-qt
cmake -B /tmp/fcitx5-qt/build -S /tmp/fcitx5-qt \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64 \
  -DENABLE_QT4=OFF -DENABLE_QT5=OFF -DENABLE_QT6=ON
cmake --build /tmp/fcitx5-qt/build

cp /tmp/fcitx5-qt/build/qt6/platforminputcontext/libfcitx5platforminputcontextplugin.so \
   ~/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64/plugins/platforminputcontexts/
cp /tmp/fcitx5-qt/build/qt6/dbusaddons/libFcitx5Qt6DBusAddons.so* \
   ~/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64/lib/
```

#### OCR Backend (Optional)

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.local/share/mark-shot/ocr-venv
~/.local/share/mark-shot/ocr-venv/bin/pip install -U pip rapidocr onnxruntime
```

### Build Steps

```bash
# Wayland (with LayerShellQt)
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# X11 / Ubuntu with local Qt 6
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/Qt/6.7.3/gcc_64

# Build
cmake --build build
```

LayerShellQt is detected automatically. When found, full Wayland layer-shell support is enabled. When absent, the build succeeds and falls back to standard fullscreen windows at runtime.

### Installation

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix "$HOME/.local"
```

This installs the binary, helper scripts (`mark-shot-ocr`, `mark-shot-translate`), desktop entries, and icons.
